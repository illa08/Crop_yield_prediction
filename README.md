# Crop_yield_prediction
We have created a "Crop Yield Prediction Model" using machine learning models which is designed to forecast the amount of crop production in a given area.
It uses various input features like year(in which the data has been recorded), average_rain_fall_mm_per_year, pesticides_tonnes, avg_temp, Area (country name), Item (which shows the different crops grown).

We have used three machine learning model linear regression, lasso, ridge and decision tree regressor out of which decision tress performs the best with an accuracy of 97%.
The goal of such a model is to help farmers, agronomists, and policymakers optimize resource usage, improve decision-making, and enhance food security by providing accurate yield estimates in advance.
